Hello, my name is Maximilian Key, and I am a student programmer.
I study at Bit Academy in Amsterdam, following the front-end development track.
I have experience with HTML/CSS, Bulma, Tailwind, and JavaScript.
I also have some experience with C and C#.
In my free time, I enjoy gaming and video editing.
I have a very abstract view of the world, so my behavior and norms are influenced by this perspective.
I enjoy listening to music while doing activities like coding.
These are all the interesting parts about me!
